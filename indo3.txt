THEN WIDI GOT UP AND SANG A SONG AND JONI PLAYED THE GUITAR FOR HER.
EVERYONE WAS QUIET WHEN SHE SANG. THEN THEY SHOUTED AND CLAPPED AND
CALLED FOR ANOTHER SONG. EVEN THE JAKARTA STUDENTS CALLED FOR ANOTHER
SONG. SO WIDI SANG 'BLUE SKIES'. "I NEVER SAW THE SUN, SHINING SO
BRIGHT, NEVER SAW THINGS GOING SO RIGHT, NEVER SAW THE DAYS HURRYING
BY, WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE, OH HOW THEY FLY...", SHE SANG, AND SHE
LOOKED AT JONI AND THEIR EYES MET. THE NEXT DAY THE STUDENTS WENT
BACK TO JOGJA. WIDI TALKED TO HER FATHER ABOUT HER SINGING. HE FOUND
A TEACHER FOR HER. SHE HAD THREE LESSONS EVERY WEEK. SHE SANG WITH
JONI TOO. JONI OFTEN WENT TO WIDI'S HOUSE. HE TOOK HIS GUITAR WITH
HIM. HE PLAYED AND WIDI SANG. WIDI WAS HAPPY. SHE LIKED TO SING WITH
JONI, AND SHE LIKED TO TALK WITH HIM TOO. WIDI LEARNED MANY NEW SONGS
AND JONI PLAYED THEM ON HIS GUITAR. BUT WIDI DID NOT THING ABOUT HER
SCHOOLWORK. SHE ONLY THOUGHT ABOUT HER SINGING AND ABOUT JONI. SO HER
SCHOOLWORK WAS NOT GOOD. HER FATHER WAS VERY ANGRY. "DO YOUR
SCHOOLWORK, HE SAID. "WORK HARD AT SCHOOL OR YOU CANNOT STUDY
SINGING.
WIDI WAS UNHAPPY. IN THE EVENING JONI CAME TO HER HOUSE. SHE TOLD
JONI ABOUT IT. HE SAID, "YOUR FATHER IS RIGHT. I AM GOING TO HELP
YOU. WE CAN DO OUR LESSONS HERE EVERY EVENING.
WIDI WAS VERY HAPPY AGAIN. SHE LOOKED AT JONI AND SHE SAID,"YOU
ALWAYS HELP ME. WHY DO YOU DO IT?
JONI'S FACE WAS RED. HE DID NOT ANSWER HER QUESTION, BUT HE KNEW THE
ANSWER. NOW ALL OF JONI AND WIDI'S FRIENDS KNEW ABOUT THEM. THEIR
FRIENDS SOMETIMES CALLED THEM ROMI AND JULI AND NOT JONI AND WIDI.
AT SCHOOL THEY WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER. THEN ONE DAY, ONE OF WIDI'S
FRIENDS CAME TO SEE HER. HER NAME WAS ENDANG. ENDANG ALWAYS LIKED TO
TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. SHE OFTEN DID NOT SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT
THEM. WIDI DID NOT LIKE HER VERY MUCH. "WIDI, ENDANG SAID, "DID YOU
MEET JONI LAST NIGHT?
"WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
"I JUST WANT TO KNOW, SAID ENDANG. "I WANT TO HELP YOU. I'M YOUR
FRIEND.
"JONI
WAS AT HOME. WE DID NOT MEET LAST NIGHT. HE HAD A LOT OF HOMEWORK,
ANSWERED WIDI. "PERHAPS HE FINISHED IT QUICKLY. WHEN I SAW HIM LAST
NIGHT HE WASN'T DOING HIS HOMEWORK. HE WAS WALKING WITH A FRIEND. A
BEAUTIFUL FRIEND.
"IT WAS NOT JONI, SAID WIDI. "YOU WERE WRONG. IT WAS JUST A BOY LIKE
JONI.
"NO,"ENDANG ANSWERED. "IT WAS JONI. I SPOKE TO HIM. THE GIRL WAS VERY
BEAUTIFUL. SHE AND JONI WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT HOMEWORK.
WIDI DID NOT SAY ANYTHING. "I FOLLOWED THEM, ENDANG SAID. "THEY WENT
TO A MOVIE. DON'T CRY, WIDI. JONI'S NOT GOOD. FORGET ABOUT HIM.
"DON'T SAY THAT. LEAVE ME. I WANT TO THINK.
"FORGET HIM, WIDI. HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU. HE'S ONLY PLAYING WITH YOU,
SAID ENDANG. FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS WIDI STAYED AWAY FROM JONI. AT
SCHOOL SHE STAYED WITH HER  GIRLFRIENDS. SHE DID NOT TALK TO JONI.
JONI CAME TO HER HOUSE IN THE EVENING BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER THE
DOOR. JONI DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT. WHY DOESN'T SHE TALK TO ME, HE
THOUGHT. DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG? THEN HE WAS ANGRY. SHE HAS ANOTHER
BOYFRIEND, HE THOUGHT. SHE DOES NOT LOVE ME NOW. HE WAS VERY SAD.
WIDI WAS VERY SAD TOO, BUT SHE DID NOT SHOW JONI. SHE SMILED AND
LAUGHED. BUT IT WAS JUST A GAME. JONI SAW HER. SHE IS HAPPY, HE
THOUGHT. THAT IS GOOD. BUT WHY DOESN'T SHE LOVE ME NOW? JONI WENT TO
WIDI'S HOUSE AGAIN. HE WANTED TO TALK TO HER. HE WANTED TO ASK HER
MANY QUESTIONS. HE WAITED FOR A LONG TIME, BUT WIDI DID NOT COME OUT.
JONI DID NOT GO AWAY. HE JUST SAT AND WAITED. THEN WIDI CAME OUT.
"WHAT DO YOU WANT? SHE ASKED. "I WANT TO TALK TO YOU!
"I'M VERY BUSY NOW. I HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK. PLEASE GO NOW.
"WIDI, WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS? ARE YOU ILL? SAID JONI. WIDI DID NOT
SAY ANYTHING BUT SHUT THE DOOR WITH A LOUD NOISE. JONI KNOCKED ON THE
DOOR AGAIN, AND SHOUTED HER NAME. THERE WAS NO ANSWER. PEOPLE FROM
OTHER HOUSES LOOKED AT HIM. HE SAW THEM AND HE WENT AWAY. HE DID NOT
GO HOME BUT HE WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS FOR A LONG TIME. THE NEXT
DAY WIDI WAS IN THE TOWN WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS. THEY WENT INTO A
SHOP AND LOOKED AT SOME BOOKS. WIDI BOUGHT ONE. THEN SHE HEARD
SOMEONE BEHIND HER. SHE TURNED AND JONI WAS THERE WITH A BEAUTIFUL
GIRL. "YOU! SAID WIDI AND SHE CRIED. "IS SHE YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?
AND WIDI TURNED AWAY. SHE WANTED TO RUN. JONI HELD HER ARM WITH HIS
HAND. "WIDI! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WAIT!
"DON'T TOUCH ME. I WANT TO GO,  CRIED WIDI. "LISTEN, WIDI. YOU'RE
WRONG. I UNDERSTAND NOW. THIS IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
"I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU...WHAT DID YOU SAY?
"THIS ISN'T MY GIRLFRIEND. SHE IS SUTINAH. SHE'S MY AUNT.
"YOUR AUNT? BUT, BUT...?
"THAT'S RIGHT, SAID SUTINAH. "JONI'S MOTHER IS MY SISTER.
"BUT YOU'RE SO YOUNG, SAID WIDI. "JONI'S MOTHER WAS THE FIRST IN THE
FAMILY. I WAS THE LAST CHILD. MY MOTHER HAD ELEVEN CHILDREN.
"BUT ENDANG TOLD ME... SAID WIDI, AND SHE CRIED AGAIN. "ENDANG WAS
WRONG, JONI SAID. "SUTINAH IS STAYING HERE FOR TWO WEEKS. I AM
SHOWING HER AROUND. "I THOUGHT...
SAID WIDI. SHE LAUGHED AND CRIED AT THE SAME TIME. "I KNOW, SAID
JONI. "YOU WERE WRONG.
THEN THEY SAID NOTHING. THERE WAS NO NEED. IN A FEW SECONDS
EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT. THEY WERE HAPPY AGAIN. "LETS GO, SAID
SUTINAH. "EVERYBODY IS WATCHING US.
JONI AND WIDI LOOKED. THEY WERE STILL IN THE BOOKSHOP. PEOPLE LOOKED
AT THEM AND SMILED. JONI AND WIDI WALKED OUT OF THE BOOKSHOP
TOGETHER. OUTSIDE, THE SUN SHONE. "WAIT FOR ME, SHOUTED SUTINAH. BUT
THEY DID NOT HEAR HER. "WAIT, WIDI'S FRIEND ESTI SAID TO SUTINAH.
"COME WITH ME. JONI AND WIDI ARE BUSY.
SUTINAH STOPPED. SHE SMILED. "YES THEY ARE, AREN'T THEY?
"LETS GO, SAID ESTI. "I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THE TOWN.
ESTI AND SUTINAH WATCHED JONI AND WIDI WALK AWAY TOGETHER. "THEY LOOK
NICE TOGETHER, SAID SUTINAH. "YES THEY DO. SAID ESTI. "YOU SHOULD
HEAR THEM SING.
"YES, JONI TOLD ME ABOUT WIDI'S SINGING. SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL TOO.
PERHAPS SHE WILL BE FAMOUS ONE DAY.
"PERHAPS SHE WILL, SAID ESTI, "BUT THAT MAKES ME AFRAID.
"OH! WHY?
"I DON'T KNOW. LOOK AT THEM NOW. THEY ARE SO HAPPY.
THEIR FUTURE SEEMS GOOD BUT I WORRY ABOUT THEM. THEY CAN SEE EACH
OTHER, BUT THEY CANNOT SEE IN FRONT OF THEM. SOMETHING BAD WILL
HAPPEN. I KNOW IT.
 "SUTINAH LAUGHED. "DON'T BE LIKE THAT. THEY ARE HAPPY. LET'S BE
HAPPY TOO.
ESTI SMILED. "PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT, SHE SAID. "COME ON. LET'S LOOK
AT SOME MORE SHOPS FIRST.
PRAMBANAN TEMPLE IS ABOUT TWENTY KILOMETRES FOR JOGJAKARTA. IT IS A
VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE. THE TEMPLE IS MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS OLD.
IT HAS SOME PICTURES ON THE WALLS. THESE PICTURES TELL THE OLD STORY
OF RAMA. RAMA LOST HIS WIFE AND FOUGHT MANY ANIMALS AND PEOPLE BEFORE
HE FOUND HER AGAIN. THE STORY OF RAMA IS A STORY OF LOVE. AT THE END
OF THE WEEK MANY PEOPLE GO TO PRAMBANAN. THEY LOOK AT THE TEMPLE AND
THEY SIT ON THE GRASS UNDER THE TALL TREES. THEY TALK ABOUT THE STORY
OF RAMA AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE. OF COURSE, THEY TALK ABOUT OTHER
THINGS TOO, BECAUSE THEY GO TO PRAMBANAN WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND
FAMILIES. ON SUNDAY, SUTINAH TOOK JONI TO PRAMBANAN. THEY WENT BY
TAXI. WIDI AND ESTI CAME TOO. THE TEMPLE IS ON THE MAIN ROAD TO
ANOTHER CITY, AND THE ROAD WAS VERY BUSY.
PEOPLE WALKED ON THE EDGE AND BICYCLES, CARTS, TRUCKS, BUSES AND CARS
FILLED THE REST OF THE ROAD. SUTINAH WANTED TO LOOK AT THE GREEN
FIELDS, BUT SHE COULD NOT.
"PLEASE DRIVE MORE SLOWLY, SHE SAID TO THE TAXI DRIVER. THE DRIVER
SAID YES, BUT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TAXI WAS GOING FAST AGAIN. NEAR
A CORNER THE TAXI MOVED OUT TO PASS ANOTHER CAR. BUT SUDDENLY A BUS
CAME ROUND THE CORNER TOWARDS THEM. THE TAXI COULD NOT GO BACK TO THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD. THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME. WIDI WAS AFRAID.
JONI WAS AFRAID. JONI DID NOT THINK OF HIMSELF. HE QUICKLY PUSHED
WIDI DOWN BEHIND THE SEAT. THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE AND THE TAXI
STOPPED. THE BUS DID NOT HIT THE TAXI, BUT THE TAXI WENT OFF THE
ROAD. THE BUS DRIVER WAS VERY ANGRY. HE SHOUTED AT THE DRIVER OF THE
TAXI AND THEN DROVE AWAY.
EVERYONE CLIMBED OUT OF THE TAXI. WIDI WAS STILL AFRAID, BUT JONI
HELD HER. JONI WAS VERY ANGRY. "YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU, WIDI?
"NO, JONI. THANK YOU.
THEY DID    NOT SPEAK AGAIN BUT THEIR EYES SAID MANY THINGS. THEY
PUSHED THE TAXI BACK ON THE ROAD AND DROVE SLOWLY TO PRAMBANAN.
NOBODY SAID VERY MUCH, BUT EVERYBODY THOUGHT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. AT
PRAMBANAN THEY WERE HAPPY AGAIN. THEY LOOKED AT THE TEMPLE AND THEN
SAT ON THE GRASS UNDER THE TREES. JONI HAD HIS GUITAR WITH HIM. HE
PLAYED AND THEY LISTENED. THEM WIDI SANG. MANY PEOPLE CAME NEAR AND
LISTENED TO HER. SOON MORE THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LISTENING. THE
SONG ENDED AND THE PEOPLE CLAPPED. "MORE! MORE! THEY SHOUTED. WIDI
SANG AGAIN. THEN SHE WAS TIRED AND STOPPED. SLOWLY THE PEOPLE WENT
AWAY, BUT ONE MAN STAYED. HE SPOKE TO WIDI. "MY NAME IS AGUS SUTOMO,
HE SAID. "YOU HAVE A VERY BEAUTIFUL VOICE. I CAN HELP YOU. DO YOU
WANT TO SING WITH MY BAND? WE NEED A GOOD SINGER LIKE YOU.
WIDI LOOKED AT JONI. "SPEAK TO WIDI'S FATHER FIRST, HE SAID TO AGUS.
HE TOLD MR SUTOMO WIDI'S NAME AND HER ADDRESS. "I AM GOING TO SPEAK
TO YOUR FATHER SOON, MR SUTOMO SAID TO WIDI. THEY TALKED FOR A FEW
MINUTES AND THEN MR SUTOMO SAID GOODBYE. WIDI AND JONI WERE VERY
HAPPY. "YOUR GOING TO BE A FAMOUS SINGER,"
JONI SAID. "I KNOW THAT.
THEY SANG TOGETHER IN THE TAXI ON THE WAY HOME. THE BEGINNING OF THE
DAY HAD NOT BEEN GOOD, BUT NOW EVERYTHING SEEMED RIGHT. AS WIDI SANG,
SHE WATCHED THE DANCERS. THEY MOVED WITH THE MUSIC. THEY LOOKED UP
AT HER AND SMILED. SHE SMILED BACK. IT WAS HER FIFTH NIGHT WITH AGUS
SUTOMO'S BAND, AND EACH NIGHT WAS BETTER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE. EACH
NIGHT MORE PEOPLE CAME TO LISTEN AND DANCE. EACH NIGHT HER SINGING
WAS STRONGER. AT FIRST SHE FELT AFRAID WHEN PEOPLE REALLY LISTENED
TO HER, BUT NOW SHE LIKED IT. AT THE END OF EACH NIGHT SHE FELT VERY
TIRED, BUT SHE ALSO FELT VERY GOOD. JONI SAID SHE WOULD BE A FAMOUS
SINGER, AND PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT. SHE LIKED THE IDEA. WIDI STOPPED
SINGING NOW AND THE DANCERS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS. SHE COULD HEAR
THEM TALKING. "SHE'S VERY GOOD, ISN'T SHE?
