HER FACE BECAME RED AS EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER. "NO, I CAN'T SING,
SHE SAID. "ESTI, YOU SING AGAIN, PLEASE.
BUT ESTI SAID, "NO, I'M TOO TIRED. YOU SING, WIDI. WE WANT TO LISTEN
TO YOU. YOU'RE ALWAYS QUITE.
THEN JONI SAID, "YES, WIDI, SING FOR US, PLEASE!
AND HER FACE BECAME REDDER AS HE SMILED. NOW EVERYBODY WAS CALLING
OUT, "YES, YOU MUST SING FOR US.
WIDI'S FACE FELT HOT AND RED AND SHE SAID, "DON'T TELL ME THAT. YOU
ARE WORSE THAN MY MOTHER AND FATHER. THEY ALWAYS SAY, DO THIS. DO
THAT'.
BUT THEN SHE LOOKED AT JONI AND HE WAS STILL SMILING. SO SHE SAID,
"ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU MUST PUT YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR EARS.
EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND WIDI BEGAN TO SING. AS SHE SANG WIDI LISTENED
TO JONI'S GUITAR. HIS PLAYING HELPS ME, SHE THOUGHT. AND SHE SANG
MORE STRONGLY. BUT THEN SHE NOTICED THE OTHER STUDENTS. NO ONE WAS
TALKING. THEY WERE ALL QUITE. THEY WERE ALL LISTENING TO HER, AND
THEY WERE ALL LOOKING AT HER. AND SHE BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
AGAIN. SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THE SONG ENDED. EVERYBODY WAS STILL VERY
QUITE. THEN THEY SHOUTED AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS. WIDI HEARD, "WIDI,
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
 "WIDI, YOU CAN SING LIKE A BIRD.
"YOU MUST SING ANOTHER SONG. THAT WAS VERY GOOD.
    NOW SUDDENLY WIDI FELT VERY HAPPY. SHE LOOKED AT JONI. HE SMILED.
"YES, WIDI,  HE SAID, "SING ANOTHER SONG. DO YOU KNOW BLUE SKIES'?
AND HE BEGAN TO PLAY AGAIN. SO WIDI SANG: "BLUE SKIES, SHINING ON ME,
NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES DO I SEE...
AGAIN EVERYBODY WAS QUIET. BUT THIS TIME WIDI FELT MORE COMFORTABLE.
EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT HER, BUT THEY WERE HER FRIENDS. THEY LIKED
HER. HER MOTHER AND FATHER DID NOT NEED TO WORRY. AND AS SHE SANG,
SHE THOUGH, YES, JAKARTA WILL BE FULL OF BLUE SKIES FOR ME. IT WAS
NIGHT WHEN THE BUS REACHED THE FIRST LIGHTS OF JAKARTA. WIDI WOKE UP
AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE BRIGHT LIGHTS AND THE WIDE STREETS.
THEN SHE LOOKED AROUND THE BUS. MOST OF THE STUDENTS WERE STILL
SLEEPING. SOME WERE AWAKE AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOWS. OTHERS WERE
TALKING QUIETLY WITH THEIR FRIENDS. SLOWLY, AS THE LIGHTS SHONE INTO
THE BUS, THE STUDENTS BEGAN TO WAKE UP. SLOWLY THE NOISE IN THE BUS
BEGAN TO GROW. TINA WOKE UP AND WIDI SAID, "WE'RE HERE!
EVERYONE BECAME EXCITED AGAIN. IT WAS LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP.
SOON THE BUS WAS FILLED WITH NOISE. EVERYBODY WAS SHOUTING AND
LAUGHING. AND THEN EVERYONE BEGAN TO SING AGAIN. BUT THE DRIVE
THROUGH JAKARTA TOOK A LONG TIME. IT TOOK MORE THAN AN HOUR TO REACH
THE SCHOOL. FINALLY THEY ARRIVED. BY THAT TIME EVERYONE WAS QUIETER
AGAIN. THE JAKARTA STUDENTS WERE AT THE SCHOOL TO MEET THEM. THEY HAD
FOOD AND HOT DRINKS READY. EVERYONE ATE AND TALKED. THEN ONE OF THE
JAKARTA STUDENTS SAID, "YOU ARE ALL TIRED. WE WILL SHOW YOU YOUR
ROOMS. THE GIRLS COME THIS WAY, PLEASE, AND THE BOYS GO THAT WAY.
WIDI WENT WITH TINA AND YUN AND ESTI AND THE OTHER GIRLS. THEY WENT
TO ONE OF THE CLASSROOMS. THERE WERE BEDS ON THE FLOOR FOR THEM. THE
GIRLS CHOSE THEIR PLACES AND PUT THEIR BAGS NEAR THEIR BEDS. WIDI
CHOSE THE BED BETWEEN TINA'S AND ESTI'S. THEN THE JAKARTA GIRLS
SHOWED THEM THE BATHROOM AND SAID GOODNIGHT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE
BATHROOM AND MANY GIRLS, SO WIDI AND TINA AND YUN AND ESTI WENT BACK
TO THE SLEEPING ROOM TO WAIT. THEY SAT ON THEIR BEDS AND TALKED.
"THAT WAS A NICE TRIP IN THE BUS, WASN'T IT? SAID TINA. "YES, IT WAS
FUN, WASN'T IT? SAID ESTI. "HEY, YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VOICE, SAID
YUN. "I DIDN'T KNOWN THAT BEFORE.
"YES, YOU SANG BEAUTIFULLY, SAID TINA. "DID I?
WIDI SMILED. SHE FELT HAPPY. "YES, YOU DID, ESTI SAID,"AND JONI
PLAYED THE GUITAR VERY NICELY FOR YOU TOO.
   "YES, TINA SAID. "HE LIKES YOU.
"HE DOESN'T. SAID YUN. "OH, WHY NOT? TINA ASKED. "WELL, LAST WEEK
WIDI AND ESTI INVITED HIM TO COME TO A MOVIE WITH US. HE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME.
"ANYWAY, HIS GUITAR IS HIS GIRLFRIEND, ESTI SAID. "DID YOU SEE HIM
WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP ON THE BUS? HE HAD HIS ARMS ROUND HIS GUITAR.
 WIDI DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON. BUT SHE HOPED
THAT YUN AND ESTI WERE WRONG. THEN THE BATHROOM WAS FREE AND THE
GIRLS TOOK THEIR TURNS TO WASH. WIDI WENT LAST. THE BOYS' BATHROOM
WAS NEXT TO THE GIRLS' BATHROOM. NEXT TO IT WAS AN OPEN WASHROOM.
WHEN WIDI CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM THE BOYS' BATHROOM WAS QUITE. ALL
THE BOYS HAD GONE TO BED. BUT JONI WAS IN THE OPEN WASHROOM. HE WAS
WASHING SOMETHING IN A BASIN. "HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JONI? WIDI
CALLED. "I'M WASHING MY SHIRT, JONI ANSWERED. "HEY, DID YOU ONLY
BRING ONE SHIRT? WIDI ASKED. SHE SAID IT AS A JOKE. JONI LAUGHED AND
SAID, "WELL, I ONLY HAVE TWO SHIRTS. WHEN I SAW YOU IN THE TOWN LAST
WEEK I WAS COMING FROM THE MARKET. I SOLD MY OTHER SHIRT. I WANTED
THE MONEY FOR THE TRIP. BUT I'M GLAD. THIS WEEKEND IS GOING TO BE
FUN.
AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN. WIDI COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING. SHE FELT SORRY
ABOUT HER JOKE. BUT SHE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING. SHE JUST   STOOD AND
WATCHED JONI. AT LAST SHE SAID SOFTLY, "GOODNIGHT, JONI. SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING.
AND SHE WALKED SLOWLY AWAY.   IN THE MORNING, JONI WOKE AND WENT TO
WASH. OTHERS WERE ALREADY THERE, SO HE HAD TO WAIT IN THE LINE. WIDI
WAS WAITING IN THE GIRLS' LINE. SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL. SOMEONE CAME
OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND SAID, "THERE'S NOT MUCH WATER.
"DON'T WORRY! SAID ONE OF THE JAKARTA STUDENTS. "WE ARE PUMPING MORE.
JONI'S TURN SOON CAME. THERE WAS ONLY A LITTLE WATER, BUT MORE WATER
WAS COMING IN. HE THREW  THE WATER OVER HIMSELF AND THEN COVERED
HIMSELF WITH SOAP. HE SANG AS HE WASHED . HE STOPPED HIS SINGING WHEN
HE LOOKED IN THE WATER TANK. IT WAS EMPTY, AND NO MORE WATER WAS
COMING INTO IT. HE WAITED A MOMENT AND THEN CALLED OUT. THE OTHERS
OUTSIDE WERE MAKING A LOT OF NOISE, AND THEY DID NOT HEAR HIM. HE PUT
HIS  SARONG AROUND HIM AND OPENED THE DOOR. "HEY, THERE'S NO WATER,
HE CALLED. EVERYBODY LAUGHED. "A GHOST! THEY SHOUTED. JONI'S BODY AND
HAIR WERE STILL WHITE WITH SOAP. ONE OF THE JAKARTA STUDENTS CAME
RUNNING. "DON 'T USE THE BATHROOM! THE PUMP IS BROKEN!
EVERYBODY LAUGHED AGAIN. "HEY, YOU'LL HAVE TO BE A GHOST ALL DAY,
THEY SHOUTED. JONI FELT UNCOMFORTABLE. HE WENT BACK INTO THE BATHROOM
AND TRIED TO RUB THE SOAP OFF HIS BODY WITH HIS SARONG. MOST OF THE
SOAP STAYED ON HIM. WHEN HE CAME OUT, WIDI AND TINA WERE STILL THERE.
ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS HAD GONE. "DON'T WORRY, JONI", WIDI SAID. "MY
AUNT IDA LIVES NEAR HERE. YOU CAN GO AND HAVE A BATH THERE. WE'LL
TAKE YOU.
WIDI AND TINA AND JONI TOOK A BECAK TO WIDI'S AUNT'S HOUSE. IT WAS
A BIG HOUSE IN A STREET FULL OF BIG HOUSES WITH BEAUTIFUL GARDENS.
THERE WAS A HIGH FENCE AROUND THE GARDEN. WIDI RANG THE BELL AND A
SERVANT ANSWERED IT. THE SERVANT CALLED WIDI'S AUNT, AND SHE MET JONI
AND TINA. SHE ASKED THEM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE AND SHE WELCOMED THEM
WARMLY, BUT JONI FELT UNCOMFORTABLE. THE HOUSE WAS SO RICH. WIDI
EXPLAINED ABOUT THE WATER AT THE SCHOOL. SO AUNT IDA CALLED ONE OF
HER SERVANTS AND THE SERVANT SHOWED JONI THE BATHROOM. JONI HAD HIS
BATH. THEN WIDI AND TINA TOOK THEIR BATH, AND JONI TALKED TO AUNT
IDA. HER SERVANT BROUGHT HIM TEA. "YOU AND WIDI ARE CLASSMATES?
AUNT IDA ASKED. "YES, BU, JONI ANSWERED. "DO YOU LIVE NEAR HER
PARENTS' HOUSE?
"NO, BU, JONI ANSWERED. HE HELD HIS CUP ON HIS KNEE AND LOOKED DOWN
AT THE FLOOR. "AND WHERE DO YOUR PARENTS LIVE?
AUNT IDA ASKED. JONI NAMED THE SMALL VILLAGE WHERE HIS PARENTS LIVED.
"AH, I KNOW IT WELL. MY HUSBAND IS FROM THE NEXT VILLAGE, KERTEK. HE
IS AN ENGINEER FOR AN OIL COMPANY HERE. BUT WE GO TO KERTEK EVERY
YEAR AT IDUL FITRI AND WE PASS THROUGH YOUR VILLAGE.
JONI FELT MORE COMFORTABLE. THEY ARE JUST VILLAGE PEOPLE LIKE ME, HE
THOUGHT. BUT THEN HE ALSO FELT A LITTLE ANGRY. IF HER HUSBAND IS AN
ENGINEER AND A VILLAGER HE SHOULD WORK IN A VILLAGE, JONI THOUGHT.
KERTEK IS A POOR AND THE WATER SUPPLY IS BAD AND THERE IS NO
ELECTRICITY. AN ENGINEER COULD DO MANY THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE, BUT
INSTEAD HE WORKS IN JAKARTA IN ORDER TO BECOME RICH. "AND WHAT WILL
YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE SCHOOL?
AUNT IDA WAS ASKING HIM. JONI LOOKED AT HER. "MY PARENTS CANNOT
AFFORD TO SEND ME TO UNIVERSITY, SO I WILL STUDY TO BECOME A TEACHER.
HE SAW WIDI AND TINA COME INTO THE ROOM AGAIN, AND HE SMILED AT THEM.
"AND YOU, WIDI, WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE SCHOOL?
AUNT IDA ASKED. "OH, I DON'T KNOW, AUNT. I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET, WIDI
SAID. "WELL, MY GIRL, DON'T JUST WAIT AROUND TO GET MARRIED. STUDY
SOMETHING SO THAT YOU WORK. LOOK AT ME. I DIDN'T STUDY AND I MARRIED
A MAN WHO BECAME RICH, SO PEOPLE SAY I AM LUCKY. BUT I DON'T WORK AND
MY LIFE IS RICH AND STUPID. YOU THINK THAT, DON'T YOU, JONI? WELL,
IT'S TRUE!
JONI'S FACE BECAME RED. "PARDON ME, AUNT IDA CONTINUED, "WHEN JAKARTA
PEOPLE THINK SOMETHING, THEY SAY IT.
"WIDI WILL BECOME A FAMOUS SINGER, JONI SAID. "SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL
VOICE.
"YES, THAT'S RIGHT, SAID TINA, AND WIDI LAUGHED. "WELL, THAT IS
BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING, AUNT IDA SAID. "BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO
THAT, BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT. TAKE SINGING LESSONS. NOW, HAVE YOU HAD
YOUR BREAKFAST?
AND SHE ORDERED THE SERVANT TO PREPARE FOOD. AFTER THEIR BREAKFAST
THEY ALL FELT MORE COMFORTABLE, AND WHEN THEY LEFT AUNT IDA'S HOUSE
THEY WERE HAPPY. THEY THANKED AUNT IDA FOR HER KINDNESS AND RETURNED
TO THE SCHOOL. BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL THEIR CLASSMATES
WERE NOT THERE. THEY DID NOT KNOW THE PROGRAMME FOR THE DAY, SO THEY
WAITED AT THE SCHOOL. THEY TALKED FOR A WHILE. JONI WAS HAPPY TO BE
NEAR WIDI. TINA LOOKED AT THEM AND SMILED TO HERSELF. THEN TINA
SAID,"GET YOUR GUITAR, JONI.
SO JONI GOT HIS GUITAR AND WIDI SANG. AT LUNCHTIME THE OTHER STUDENTS
CAME BACK TO THE SCHOOL. THEN WIDI AND JONI AND TINA JOINED IN THE
AFTERNOON PROGRAMME. THAT DAY AND ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY THEY VISITED
MANY INTERESTING PLACES. JONI AND WIDI WERE TOGETHER MOST OF THE DAY.
THEY TALKED. THEY TALKED ABOUT SCHOOL, THEY TALKED ABOUT NEW SONGS,
THEY TALKED ABOUT MOST THINGS. THEY DID NOT TALK ABOUT LOVE, BUT IT
CAME TO THEM. THE THREE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY. ON THE SUNDAY
EVENING THE JAKARTA STUDENTS ARRANGED A PARTY. MANY STUDENTS GOT UP
AND SANG SONGS OR PLAYED.
